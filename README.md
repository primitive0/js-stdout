# js-stdout

## A wrapper around process.stdout/stderr with colors support

```javascript
const stdout = require('js-stdout');

stdout.write('Hello from stdout!');
```

## What for? 
I needed a tiny wrapper around `process` and also colors support, so I decided to write this small lib.

## TODO:
- [ ] Colors support (finish)
- [ ] Documentation

## Status
The library is absolutely stable because of its small size.
